  "bio": "Jack Clark broke into the major leagues at the age of 19 with the San Francisco Giants and proceeded to terrorize pitchers for the next 18 years. Jack was a four-time All Star and two-time Silver Slugger winner. Jack played in two World Series (Cardinals 1985 and 1987). Nicknamed “The Ripper,” Jack was one of the most feared hitters of his generation, leading the major leagues in walks in 1987 and 1989 and ranking 50th all time in the category. In the book “You’re Missin’ a Great Game,” Whitey Herzog said, “Jack Clark could pull a bullet .I could be blindfolded and tell when Jack was taking (batting practice). … The man’s power scared people, kept the defenses honest and kept our jackrabbits circling the bases.” Jack slugged 340 home runs over the course of his career. His three-run homer in the ninth inning of Game Six of the 1985 NLCS against the Dodgers won the pennant for the Cardinals and remains one of the most memorable blasts in the storied franchise’s history.",
